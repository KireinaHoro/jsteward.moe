## Summary

This week is mainly about decoupling toolchain from Android Build System so as to enable a local build of Android on the phone itself.  Toolchains for the following programming languages are needed throughout the entire build:

  * C/C++ (Android Platform)
  * Java (Android Platform, apps)
  * Go (build system, i.e. Soong & Blueprint)

As of current, the entire source tree is mounted onto the phone via NFS.  Tweak kernel config to enable NFS, emerge `net-fs/nfs-utils`, then mount the filesystem.  Refer to `nfs(5)` for more information.  The articles in this report assume that the AOSP tree is mounted at `/import/lineageos`.

The last week's work sums up into the following two articles:

  * [Enabling aarch64 as a host architecture for Android Build (WIP)]({filename}/Android/aarch64-build-host.md): logs modifications made to accomodate system toolchains for `aarch64` into the build system.
    * This is necessary as Google doesn't provide prebuilt toolchains for `aarch64` hosts; the build system assumes `x86` here and there as well.
  * [Using distcc to speed up builds on phone]({filename}/SysAdmin/distcc-speed-up.md): speed up Portage builds on phone with `distccd` running on the laptop.
  * [C/C++ Toolchain for Android Build on aarch64 (WIP)]({filename}/Android/toolchain-for-android.md): attempt to get the set of toolchains for building Android on aarch64.

This week did not achieve any significant milestones; instead, several obstacles are discovered.  They are discussed in the relative articles.
