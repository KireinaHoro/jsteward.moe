## Summary

The last week was about writing guides and automatic setup scripts for users.  The following package has been added to the overlay:

  * `sys-apps/sharkbait-setup`: setup for Android container on a SharkBait system

The following articles have been added to the blog:

  * [Clang/LLVM toolchain with sanitizers support for Android]({filename}/Android/toolchain-clang-llvm-with-sanitizers-for-android.md)
  * [SharkBait User Guide]({filename}/SharkBait/sharkbait-user-guide.md)
  * [SharkBait Porter's Guide]({filename}/SharkBait/sharkbait-porters-guide.md)

All the repositories I've created for the SharkBait project now have a concise `README.md` now.
