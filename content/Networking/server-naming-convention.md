## Preface

With a bunch of servers, it's necessary that they're named in a consistent manner. This article describes how the
machines should be named.

## Basic rule

A machine name should consist of the following three parts:

 - a unique identifier for the machine (Romaji of Japanese words in one Kanji, examples are given below)
 - the name of the ISP (e.g. `vultr` or `linode`)
 - the IATA code of the geographically closest airport (e.g. `HND` for machines in Tokyo)

## Examples for the Japanese words to be chosen

光　影　日　月　雨　雪　風　嵐
海　川　山　空　森　池　滝　島
