I'm currently a senior student at Peking University majoring in Computer Science and Technology and a member of the _Turing Class_ honor program at Peking University.  My advisor is [Prof. Yun Liang](https://ericlyun.github.io) at CECA, Peking University.

My research interests span the broad area of Computer Systems, especially in Computer Architecture, Embedded Systems, and High Performance Computing.  I enjoy building highly performant and efficient systems via software and hardware approaches.  My experience in FPGAs, system programming, and parallel programming, enables me to effectively solve many problems in these fields.  You can find my full CV [here](/images/cv.pdf).

I also keep a blog (updated irregularly) to record experiences when dealing with various interesting systems, from old-school Unix to Android to RISC-V-on-FPGA endeavors.  Follow [this link](/blog_index.html) or the "Blog" link in the top right corner of this page to find out more.  Don't hesitate to comment or contact me to discuss on topics I've covered!
