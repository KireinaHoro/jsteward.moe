This site has been lacking a comment system for a long time (ever since its [establishment in 2016]({filename}hello-world.rst)).  That was not a deliberate decision: I was simply too lazy to connect a proper comment system, and not much people wanted to leave a comment.  I received almost no reach-outs due to the blog articles despite that the readers may easily find [my contacts]({filename}/pages/about-and-contact.md).

Recently, however, in an effort to speed up the site build process on Travis, I purged all the themes that are not used on this site, and discovered that the theme actually had a Disqus template.  Consequently, this should be the first article with a comment section the moment it's published.
